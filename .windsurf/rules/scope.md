Always use the internet to find official documents from third parties that we use their services. For example, we use VS Code. So we should never come up with or hallucinate what we should do, anything extension VS Code related because VS Code has all of its official documents for implementing and using their tools within your own project. Every other third party has sets of developer documents for developers to utilize their tools, services, or products within their own projects. So refrain from ever hallucinating and creating features and functionalities that I did not tell you to create. When you are stuck inside of eras and are seeing the same error consistently or more than once, I've noticed the AI loves to try to simplify or create its own fix that usually never works. What I have found the golden rule is if you have an error, somebody in the world has the same error. So search the internet for how to resolve that error, problem, or issue within your development project.
