## 📊 Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working Excellently
1. **Core Functionality** - All features operational
2. **Error Detection** - Industry-leading validation
3. **Live Preview** - Real-time updates with device modes
4. **Performance** - <2ms analysis, <50ms preview generation
5. **Examples** - Three categories with working templates
6. **Problems Panel** - Filterable diagnostics with navigation
7. **Theme Support** - Light/dark modes functional
8. **Responsiveness** - Mobile-friendly layout

### 🎨 What Needs Polish (Identified Gaps)
Based on comparison with **CodeSandbox**, **StackBlitz**, and **shadcn**:

1. **Header** - Lacks professional app shell structure
2. **Toolbar** - Feels like random buttons vs structured controls
3. **Pane Context** - Editor/preview lack inline headers
4. **Visual Hierarchy** - Information density could be improved
5. **Iconography** - Mixed emojis vs professional icons
6. **Typography** - Minor inconsistencies across components
7. **Examples Layout** - Single-column vs modern grid
8. **Status Bar** - Hard to scan vs segmented style
9. **Problems Panel** - Visually heavy vs compact dev tools

**None of these gaps affect functionality - they're pure polish.**
