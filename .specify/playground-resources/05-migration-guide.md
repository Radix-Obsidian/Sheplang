## 🌟 What You Unlock: Feature by Feature

### 🗄️ Real Database Integration
**Playground**: In-memory data (disappears on refresh)
**Extension**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase integration

```sheplang
// Extension only - persistent data
action saveUserData(name, email) {
  call POST "/users" with name, email  // Real API call
  load GET "/users" into users         // Load from real database
  show Dashboard
}
```

### 🤖 AI-Powered Code Generation
**Playground**: Manual coding only
**Extension**: Claude AI writes entire applications

**Try this in extension:**
1. Right-click in your `.shep` file
2. Select "AI: Generate Complete CRUD App"
3. Type: "User management system with roles and permissions"
4. Watch AI write 50+ lines of production-ready code

### 🎨 Import from Design Tools
**Playground**: Manual UI creation
**Extension**: Import from Figma, Webflow, existing React apps

**Import workflow:**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `ShepLang: Import from Figma`
2. Paste your Figma file URL
3. Choose components to import
4. AI generates ShepLang code automatically

### ✅ Advanced Verification System
**Playground**: Basic syntax checking
**Extension**: 4-phase verification (type safety, null safety, API validation, exhaustiveness)

**What this catches:**
- ❌ Null pointer exceptions before they happen
- ❌ Type mismatches at compile time
- ❌ API endpoint errors before deployment
- ❌ Missing error handling
