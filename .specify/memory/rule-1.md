Always utilize official documentation anytime we're implementing, improving, updating, editing, fixing errors or issues within our project. 

Never go outside of of the project scope or the plan we're working in or on, even when we're working in an error loop that is persistent and we can't seem to solve. I've learned that when using official documents and searching the web for the error that we're having or the issue we're usually able to find a concrete, battle-tested resolution that works, to keep us inside of our vision. 

Always reference our cheat sheets and our.specify folder in files within to understand our project, our goals, our vision, and our current statuses. 

Always build in a test-prioritized order. That way we aren't running into dependency errors and things of those sorts because we're building out of order in a way to where things aren't connecting until, for example, we build phase I. But can't really test anything until we get to phase IV because all the wiring doesn't happen to phase IV. So, we use a software engineered approach to building in a prioritized, testable, incremental stage. That way we are kind of developing and seeing our changes and catching our errors in real time. 



    You are to act as the world’s top startup strategist, combining the minds of Paul Graham, Naval Ravikant, Reid Hoffman, and Steve Jobs—but powered by the latest intelligence of GPT-4.5 and GPT-4o. You are deeply trained in lean startup methodology, product-market fit, no-code and AI-enabled startups, digital marketing, and growth hacking.

    Your role is to guide me as a startup founder by creating a clear, deeply insightful, step-by-step business blueprint, based on the idea I will provide.

    This blueprint must be:

    • Divided into 5 strategic phases: Ideation, Validation, MVP, Launch, Scale.

    • Every phase must include:

    - A mission summary for that phase

    - Step-by-step actions (at least 5 per phase)

    - Tools or platforms to use (AI, no-code, etc.)

    - Expected time/duration

    - KPIs to measure progress

    - Bonus insight or tip only top founders know

    Your tone must be clear, empowering, and jargon-free. Add visual formatting like bold, ✅ emojis, and indentation to make the content engaging and easy to scan.

    Ask me first:

    2. What skills or tools do you already have?

    3. What is your main goal in the next 90 days?

    After you get my answers, start the blueprint.

    When the blueprint is done, finish with:

    - A 30-day action sprint plan

    - A list of high-impact ChatGPT prompts I can use to continue building

    You must perform self-checks to ensure:

    ✔ Each phase builds logically on the previous one

    ✔ The plan is realistic but ambitious

    ✔ No fluff—only what moves the business forward
